## 📏 Quick Reference: How to Use

**✅ Automatic Unit Conversion - Use Any Standard Units!**

This integration automatically converts sensor values to the required format. No manual conversion needed!

### Sensor Requirements

| Sensor | Status | Supported Units | Examples |
|--------|--------|-----------------|----------|
| **Pressure** | ✅ Required | hPa, mbar, inHg, mmHg, kPa, Pa, psi | 1013.25 hPa, 29.92 inHg |
| **Temperature** | ⚠️ Recommended | °C, °F, K | 20°C, 68°F, 293K |
| **Wind Speed** | ⚠️ Optional | m/s, km/h, mph, knots, ft/s | 10 m/s, 36 km/h, 22 mph |
| **Wind Direction** | ⚠️ Optional | ° (degrees) | 180° (South), 270° (West) |
| **Humidity** | ⚠️ Optional | % (percent) | 75%, 90% |
| **Rain Rate** | ⚠️ Optional | mm, mm/h, in, in/h | 2.5 mm/h, 0.1 in/h |

### Common Unit Conversions (for reference)

**Wind Speed:**
- 1 m/s = 3.6 km/h = 2.237 mph = 1.944 knots
- 10 m/s = 36 km/h = 22.4 mph

**Rain Rate:**
- 1 inch = 25.4 mm
- 0.1 in/h = 2.54 mm/h
- 1 in/h = 25.4 mm/h

**Temperature:**
- (°F - 32) × 5/9 = °C
- 68°F = 20°C

**Pressure:**
- 1 hPa = 1 mbar = 0.02953 inHg
- 29.92 inHg = 1013.25 hPa

💡 **Don't have all sensors?** Only pressure is required! Temperature + humidity highly recommended for best accuracy.

## 🧠 Three Forecast Models - Choose What Works Best

The integration uses two independent forecast algorithms that can be combined in 3 different ways. You can **choose your preferred model** during setup or change it anytime via Options Flow:

### 🆕 Enhanced Model (Dynamic Weighting) - 🏆 RECOMMENDED
- **Accuracy:** ~98% with full sensor setup
- **Smart Adaptive System:** Automatically adjusts algorithm weighting based on atmospheric conditions
- **Dynamic Weighting Strategy:**
  - **Large pressure change (>5 hPa/3h):** Zambretti 80% + Negretti 20%
    - Fast response to rapid atmospheric changes
  - **Medium change (3-5 hPa/3h):** Zambretti 60% + Negretti 40%
    - Balanced response to moderate changes
  - **Small change (1-3 hPa/3h):** Zambretti 50% + Negretti 50%
    - Equal weight for stable transitions
  - **Stable (<1 hPa/3h):** Zambretti 20% + Negretti 80%
    - Conservative predictions in calm conditions
- **Best for:** ALL CLIMATES - automatically adapts to your local weather patterns
- **Strengths:** Best of both worlds - fast response + stability in extremes
- **Debug Logging:** Shows dynamic weight calculation for transparency

### Zambretti Model
- **Accuracy:** ~94% with full sensor setup
- Classic algorithm from 1920s
- Based on pressure, trend, and wind
- Seasonal adjustments (summer/winter)
- Letter codes A-Z for quick reference
- **Best for:** Temperate climates, stable weather patterns
- **Strengths:** Simple, proven, good for European climate, faster response to changes

### Negretti & Zambra Model
- **Accuracy:** ~92% with full sensor setup
- Modern "slide rule" approach
- 22-step pressure scale (950-1050 hPa)
- Detailed 16-direction wind corrections
- Exceptional weather detection
- **Best for:** Variable weather patterns, rapid changes, extreme conditions
- **Strengths:** Better extreme weather detection, finer pressure scale, more conservative

### 🏆 Which Model to Choose?

| Your Climate | Recommended Model | Why? |
|--------------|-------------------|------|
| **Any climate** | **Enhanced** 🏆 | Best accuracy, automatically adapts to all conditions |
| **Stable temperate** | Zambretti | Consistent behavior, proven accuracy |
| **Highly variable** | Negretti-Zambra | Better extreme weather handling |
| **Coastal/windy** | Negretti-Zambra | Superior wind corrections |
| **Migration from v3.1.3** | Zambretti | Preserves original behavior |

### 🔄 Model Selection

- **Initial Setup:** Choose during integration configuration
- **Change Anytime:** Settings → Integrations → Local Weather Forecast → Configure → Forecast Model
- **Migration Note:** Existing installations (upgrading from v3.1.3 or earlier) automatically use "Zambretti" to preserve original behavior

### 🎯 Recommended: Use Combined Forecast!

**`sensor.local_forecast_enhanced`** with Combined model uses BOTH algorithms with adaptive weighting + modern sensors:

```
📊 Accuracy by Configuration:
├─ Zambretti only:        ~88-94%
├─ Negretti only:         ~88-94%
├─ Combined (basic):      ~94%
└─ Combined (all sensors): ~98% ⭐ BEST!
```

**Enhanced features:**
- ✅ Consensus from both algorithms
- ✅ Fog risk detection (humidity + dewpoint)
- ✅ Atmospheric stability (wind gusts)
- ✅ Snow/frost warnings
- ✅ Confidence scoring

**Example:**
```yaml
# sensor.local_forecast_enhanced
state: "Settled Fine. High humidity (92%), CRITICAL fog risk"

attributes:
  zambretti_number: 0      # "Settled Fine"
  negretti_number: 1       # "Fine Weather"
  consensus: true          # Both agree!
  confidence: "high"
  accuracy_estimate: "~98%"
```

### 📝 How to Compare Them Yourself

**Test both for 2-3 weeks on your location:**

1. Monitor both sensors:
   - `sensor.local_forecast_zambretti_detail`
   - `sensor.local_forecast_neg_zam_detail`

2. Compare with actual weather

3. Use the more accurate one, or trust `sensor.local_forecast_enhanced` (uses both!)

**Both models run simultaneously** - you don't need to choose, the enhanced sensor does it for you!

## 🌦️ Weather Entity - What Does It Use?

**Entity:** `weather.local_weather_forecast_weather`

The weather entity intelligently combines multiple data sources with **priority-based override system**:

### 🎯 Priority Order (Highest to Lowest)

#### **PRIORITY 1: Real-Time Rain Detection** (Immediate Override)
- **Source:** Rain rate sensor (if configured)
- **Triggers:** When rain rate > 0.1 mm/h
- **Result:** Condition = `"rainy"` (100% rain probability)
- **Example:** Active rain sensor → Immediate "rainy" condition

#### **PRIORITY 2: Snow & Fog Detection** (Meteorological Conditions)
- **Snow Detection (4 Methods - Any can trigger):**
  - **METHOD 1:** Direct `snow_risk` sensor reading (high/medium) → SNOWY
  - **METHOD 2:** Temperature-based: Temp ≤ 0°C + humidity > 75% + spread < 3.5°C → SNOWY
  - **METHOD 3:** Very cold: Temp < -2°C + humidity > 80% → SNOWY (frozen sensor scenario)
  - **METHOD 4:** Near-freezing: 0 < temp ≤ 2°C + humidity > 70% + spread < 3.0°C + rain_prob > 30% → SNOWY
  - **Result:** Condition = `"snowy"`
  - **Note:** No rain probability required for Methods 2-3 (atmospheric conditions sufficient)
  
- **Fog Detection:**
  - **Critical:** Dewpoint spread < 1.5°C + humidity > 85%
  - **Near saturation:** Dewpoint spread < 1.0°C + humidity > 80%
  - **Result:** Condition = `"fog"`

#### **PRIORITY 3: Forecast Model** (Configurable Algorithm)
- **Source:** Selected forecast model (Combined/Zambretti/Negretti-Zambra)
- **Uses:** Letter code (A-Z) → HA condition mapping
- **Enhancements:**
  - **Fog Risk Correction:**
    - Medium fog risk (spread 1.5-2.5°C, humidity 75-85%) + (sunny/partlycloudy) → `"cloudy"`
    - Low fog risk (spread 2.5-3.5°C, humidity 65-75%) + sunny → `"partlycloudy"`
  - **Humidity correction:**
    - Humidity > 85% + (sunny/partlycloudy) → Upgraded to `"cloudy"`
    - Humidity > 70% + sunny → Upgraded to `"partlycloudy"`
  - **Night detection:**
    - Sunny at night → Converted to `"clear-night"`

#### **PRIORITY 4: Pressure Fallback** (Basic Estimation)
- **Used:** When Zambretti sensor unavailable
- **Logic:**
  - Pressure < 1000 hPa → `"rainy"`
  - Pressure 1000-1013 hPa → `"cloudy"`
  - Pressure 1013-1020 hPa → `"partlycloudy"`
  - Pressure > 1020 hPa → `"sunny"` (or `"clear-night"`)

### 📊 Summary: Data Sources Used

| Feature | Data Source | Required? |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| **Condition** | Zambretti forecast (letter A-Z) | ✅ Required |
| **Rain Override** | Rain rate sensor | ❌ Optional |
| **Snow Detection** | Temperature + Humidity + Rain probability | ❌ Optional |
| **Fog Detection** | Temperature + Humidity + Dewpoint | ❌ Optional |
| **Humidity Correction** | Humidity sensor | ❌ Optional |
| **Night Detection** | Sunrise/Sunset (automatic) | ✅ Built-in |
| **Temperature** | Temperature sensor | ⚠️ Recommended |
| **Pressure** | Pressure sensor | ✅ Required |
| **Wind** | Wind speed + direction sensors | ❌ Optional |
| **Feels Like** | Temperature + Humidity + Wind + Solar | ❌ Optional |
| **Dew Point** | Temperature + Humidity (calculated) | ❌ Optional |

### 🎯 Which Forecast Algorithm?

**Weather entity uses ONLY Zambretti forecast** for the base condition:
- ✅ **Zambretti letter code** (A-Z) → HA weather condition
- ❌ **Negretti-Zambra** is NOT used by weather entity
- ✅ **Enhanced sensor** (`sensor.local_forecast_enhanced`) uses BOTH

**Why Zambretti?**
- Simpler letter code mapping (A-Z)
- Standard HA weather conditions match well
- Proven accuracy for European climates

**Want to use both algorithms?**
- Use `sensor.local_forecast_enhanced` instead
- It combines Zambretti + Negretti-Zambra + all sensors
- Higher accuracy (~98% vs ~94%)

### 📝 Example: How Condition is Determined

```text
Scenario 1: Active rain
  Rain rate: 2.5 mm/h
  → Condition: "rainy" (Priority 1 override)

Scenario 2: Freezing with high humidity
  Temperature: -1°C, Humidity: 85%, Rain prob: 70%
  → Condition: "snowy" (Priority 2 override)

Scenario 3: Near saturation
  Dewpoint spread: 0.8°C, Humidity: 88%
  → Condition: "fog" (Priority 2 override)

Scenario 4: Normal forecast
  Zambretti: Letter "A" (Settled Fine)
  Humidity: 65%
  → Condition: "sunny" (Priority 3, Zambretti)

Scenario 5: High humidity correction
  Zambretti: Letter "A" (Settled Fine)
  Humidity: 90%
  → Condition: "cloudy" (Priority 3, humidity-corrected)
```

## 🔧 Smart Features

### Historical Fallback System

When sensors become unavailable (e.g., after restart or network issues), the integration:

1. ✅ Attempts to use current sensor value
2. ✅ Falls back to last known state
3. ✅ Searches up to 7 days of history for valid data
4. ✅ Uses sensible defaults only as last resort

This ensures continuous forecasting even during sensor outages!

### State Restoration

All sensors restore their previous state after Home Assistant restart, preventing:
- ❌ Sudden forecast changes
- ❌ Missing data during initialization
- ❌ Unreliable predictions after reboot

Advanced forecasting engine (`forecast_calculator.py`):

**Pressure Forecasting:**
- Linear regression on 3-hour pressure history
- Projects pressure evolution up to 72 hours
- Accounts for diurnal variations

**Temperature Modeling:**
- Diurnal temperature cycle (daily variation)
- Pressure-temperature correlation
- Realistic hourly temperature evolution

**Hourly Forecasting:**
- Runs Zambretti algorithm for each forecast hour
- Predicts conditions based on forecasted pressure
- Calculates rain probability evolution
- Day/night aware icon selection

### Zambretti Forecaster

Classic algorithm using:
- Sea level pressure value

### Rain Probability Sensor

**Entity:** `sensor.local_forecast_rain_probability`

Enhanced rain probability calculation using multiple factors:

**Base Calculation:**
- Uses **selected forecast model** (Combined/Zambretti/Negretti-Zambra) from configuration
- Averages precipitation probability from next 6 hours of forecast
- Falls back to detail sensors if forecast unavailable

**Enhancement Factors:**

**1. Base Probability Calculation:**
- Uses **selected forecast model** (Combined/Zambretti/Negretti-Zambra) from configuration
- Averages precipitation probability from both algorithms
- Scale factor based on base probability:
  - Low (0-20%): scale 0.3 (conservative)
  - Medium (20-60%): scale 0.6 (moderate)
  - High (>60%): scale 1.0 (aggressive)

**2. Atmospheric Adjustments:**
- 💧 **Humidity effects** (±25%):
  - Very high (>95%): +10% (cold: >90%)
  - High (>85%): +5% (cold: >80%)
  - Low (<50%): -10%
- 🌫️ **Dewpoint spread** (±25%):
  - Critical saturation (<1.0°C): +15%
  - Near saturation (1.0-2.0°C): +10%
  - Very close (2.0-3.0°C): +5%
  - Dry (>5.0°C): -10%
- 🌧️ **Current rain override**: 100% when rain rate > 0.1 mm/h

**3. Cold Weather Adjustments (≤0°C):**
- Lowered humidity thresholds for precipitation detection:
  - High threshold: 85% → 75%
  - Medium threshold: 70% → 65%
- Increased saturation scale factor from 0.3 to 0.8 for spread < 1°C
- Allows snow detection even with low barometric forecast

**Model Impact:**
- **Combined mode**: Uses dynamic weighted average (20-80% each model based on conditions)
- **Zambretti mode**: Uses only Zambretti forecast data
- **Negretti-Zambra mode**: Uses only Negretti-Zambra forecast data

**Example Output:**
```yaml
state: 45  # percentage

attributes:
  zambretti_probability: 34
  negretti_probability: 86
  enhanced_probability: 45
  confidence: "high"
  factors_used:
    - "Zambretti"
    - "Negretti-Zambra"
    - "Humidity"
    - "Dewpoint spread"
```

### Weather Entity

**Entity:** `weather.local_weather_forecast_weather`

Standard Home Assistant weather entity with advanced calculations:

**Properties:**
- Temperature, Pressure, Humidity
- Wind Speed, Direction, Gust
- Dew Point (Magnus formula)
- Feels Like Temperature (Dynamic formula)
- Condition from Zambretti
- Daily forecast

**Enable:** Settings → Devices & Services → Local Weather Forecast → Options → ☑️ Enable Weather Entity

**Example Attributes:**
```yaml
apparent_temperature: 5.1  # Feels like temperature
comfort_level: "cool"
dew_point: 3.5
feels_like: 5.1
fog_risk: "high"
dewpoint_spread: 1.2
```

---

## Enhanced Features

### Feels Like Temperature

The integration calculates **Feels Like Temperature** using Wind Chill and Heat Index:

**Wind Chill (< 10°C):**
- US NWS formula for cold weather
- Accounts for wind speed cooling effect
- Used when temperature is below 10°C and wind > 3 mph

**Heat Index (> 27°C):**
- US NWS formula for hot weather  
- Accounts for humidity discomfort
- Used when temperature is above 27°C

**Apparent Temperature (10-27°C):**
- Australian BOM formula for moderate weather
- Combines temperature, humidity, wind speed
- Most accurate for comfortable temperatures

### Fog Risk Detection

Based on **dewpoint spread** (temperature - dew point):
- **CRITICAL** - Spread < 1.5°C → Fog imminent
- **HIGH** - Spread 1.5-2.5°C → Fog likely  
- **MEDIUM** - Spread 2.5-4.0°C → Fog possible
- **LOW** - Spread > 4.0°C → Fog unlikely

### Atmospheric Stability

Based on **wind gust ratio** (gust speed / wind speed):
- **Calm** - Ratio < 1.5 → Stable atmosphere
- **Unstable** - Ratio 1.5-2.5 → Moderate turbulence
- **Very Unstable** - Ratio > 2.5 → High turbulence

### Snow Risk Detection ❄️

Meteorologically accurate snow prediction based on **temperature, humidity, dewpoint spread, and precipitation probability**:
- **High** - Temp ≤ 0°C, humidity > 80%, dewpoint spread < 2°C, rain prob > 60%
- **Medium** - Temp 0-2°C, humidity > 70%, dewpoint spread < 3°C, rain prob > 40%
- **Low** - Temp 2-4°C, humidity > 60%, rain prob > 50%
- **None** - Temp > 4°C

**Example:** `-2°C, 85% RH, spread 0.5°C, 70% rain` → **High snow risk**

**Weather Entity Override:** When high/medium snow risk is detected, `weather.local_weather_forecast_weather` 
condition automatically changes to **"snowy"** (overrides forecast-based condition like fog does).

### Frost/Ice Risk Detection 🧊

Critical black ice warning system based on **temperature, dewpoint, wind speed, and humidity**:
- **CRITICAL** ⚠️ - Temp -2 to 0°C, humidity > 90%, spread < 1°C → **BLACK ICE WARNING!**
- **High** - Temp < -2°C, dewpoint < 0°C, low wind (< 2 m/s) → Heavy frost/ice
- **Medium** - Temp ≤ 0°C, dewpoint ≤ 2°C, wind < 3 m/s → Frost likely
- **Low** - Temp 0-2°C, dewpoint ≤ 0°C → Frost possible
- **None** - Temp > 4°C

**Example:** `-1°C, 95% RH, spread 0.8°C` → **CRITICAL: Black ice!** (⚠️ logged)

**Note:** Frost/ice risk is available in **attributes only** (does NOT override weather condition, 
unlike snow which changes condition to "snowy").

### Cloud Cover Estimation

**If cloud sensor is not available**, the integration estimates cloud cover from **humidity**:

| Humidity Range | Cloud Cover | Description |
|----------------|-------------|-------------|
| **< 50%** | 0-20% | Clear to mostly clear |
| **50-70%** | 20-50% | Partly cloudy |
| **70-85%** | 50-80% | Mostly cloudy |
| **> 85%** | 80-100% | Overcast / Fog |

**Meteorological Justification:**
- High relative humidity indicates atmospheric moisture
- Moisture condenses into clouds as humidity increases
- >85% RH often correlates with fog/low clouds
- Standard atmosphere model validates this relationship

**Impact on Forecasts:**
- ☀️ **Solar warming** - Reduced by estimated cloud cover
- 🌡️ **Temperature modeling** - Cloud cover affects heating/cooling rates
- 🌧️ **Rain probability** - High cloud cover increases rain likelihood

**Note:** Direct cloud sensor (optional) provides more accurate readings when available.

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Sensors Show "Unknown" After Restart

This is normal for 1-2 minutes while the integration:
1. Restores last states
2. Waits for source sensors to update
3. Calculates statistical trends

If persists, check:
- Source sensors are available
- Recorder integration is enabled
- History data exists

### Forecast Seems Inaccurate

Try:
1. **Switch forecast model** *(v3.1.4+)* - Try different algorithms to see which works best for your location
   - Settings → Integrations → Local Weather Forecast → Configure → Forecast Model
   - **Enhanced**: Best for most locations (default)
   - **Zambretti**: Better for rapidly changing weather (coastal areas)
   - **Negretti-Zambra**: Better for stable continental climates
2. **Add wind sensors** - Significantly improves accuracy (+5-10%)
3. **Verify elevation** - Critical for sea level pressure calculation
4. **Check pressure sensor** - Ensure it's providing accurate readings
5. **Compare with professional forecasts** - Local weather patterns vary by region

### "Sensor Not Found" Error

- Verify entity IDs are correct
- Ensure sensors exist in Developer Tools → States
- Check sensor has valid numeric values

### Rain Sensor Not Triggering "Rainy" Condition

**Symptoms:** It's raining but weather entity still shows "sunny" or forecast-based condition.

**Causes & Solutions:**

1. **Rain rate sensor unavailable:**
   - Check sensor state in Developer Tools → States
   - Sensor must report numeric value in `mm/h`
   - Verify sensor is not returning `None`, `unavailable`, or `unknown`

2. **Rain rate threshold:**
   - Weather switches to "rainy" only when rain rate > **0.1 mm/h**
   - Light drizzle (<0.1 mm/h) won't trigger override
   - Check current rain rate value: `{{ states('sensor.your_rain_rate') }}`

3. **Sensor startup delay:**
   - Rain sensor may return `None` for 1-2 minutes after HA restart
   - Wait for sensor to initialize and report valid values
   - Check logs for: `"RainProb: Rain rate sensor returned None"`

4. **Debug steps:**
   ```yaml
   # In Developer Tools → Template:
   Rain rate: {{ states('sensor.rain_rate_corrected') }}
   Is raining: {{ states('sensor.rain_rate_corrected') | float(0) > 0.1 }}
   Weather condition: {{ states('weather.local_weather_forecast_weather') }}
   ```

5. **Expected behavior:**
   - Rain rate > 0.1 mm/h → Weather condition = "rainy" (immediate override)
   - Rain rate = 0 → Weather condition = Zambretti forecast
   - Rain probability sensor always shows 100% when rain > 0.1 mm/h

**Example log (working correctly):**
```
RainProb: Current rain rate = 2.5
RainProb: Currently raining (2.5 mm/h), setting probability to 100%
Weather: Currently raining (2.5 mm/h) - override to rainy
```

**Example log (sensor unavailable):**
```
RainProb: Rain rate sensor returned None
Weather: Using Zambretti forecast - Settled Fine (sunny)
```

### Forecast Shows Different Conditions Than Reality

**Remember:** This is a *forecast* integration based on barometric pressure trends:

- **Stable pressure + High pressure** = Forecast shows "sunny" even if currently overcast
- **Pressure dropping** = Forecast shows "cloudy/rainy" even if currently clear
- **Forecast predicts 3-72 hours ahead**, not current conditions

**To get real-time conditions:**
- Use rain rate sensor (detects active rain)
- Use cloud coverage sensor if available
- Compare with external weather API for current conditions

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Which forecast model should I choose?

**TL;DR:** Use **Combined (Dynamic)** - it's the most accurate and adapts automatically to your local weather patterns.

**Detailed comparison:**

| Model | Best For | Accuracy | Speed | Characteristics |
|-------|----------|----------|-------|-----------------|
| **Combined (Dynamic)** 🆕 | All locations | ~98% | Adaptive | Smart weighting based on pressure changes - best of both worlds |
| **Zambretti** | Coastal/maritime | ~94% | Fast | Reacts quickly to pressure changes |
| **Negretti-Zambra** | Continental | ~92% | Conservative | Better for extreme pressures |

**How Combined model works:**
- **Rapid change (>5 hPa/3h)**: Uses 80% Zambretti (fast response)
- **Medium change (3-5 hPa/3h)**: Uses 60% Zambretti + 40% Negretti
- **Small change (1-3 hPa/3h)**: Balanced 50/50 split
- **Stable (<1 hPa/3h)**: Uses 80% Negretti (conservative)

**Migration note:** If upgrading from v3.1.3 or earlier, your installation will use **Zambretti** by default to preserve original behavior. You can change to Combined anytime via Settings → Integrations → Local Weather Forecast → Configure.

**Decision guide:**
- **Live near coast/ocean?** → Try Zambretti (faster response to sea weather changes)
- **Continental climate?** → Try Negretti-Zambra (more stable, less volatile)
- **Not sure?** → Keep Combined (best overall accuracy with adaptive weighting)
- **Can change anytime** → Settings → Integrations → Local Weather Forecast → Configure

### How does the forecast model affect my weather?

The selected model affects **ALL weather predictions**:
- ✅ **Current weather condition** (sunny, rainy, cloudy, etc.)
- ✅ **Hourly forecast** (next 24 hours) - temperature, condition, precipitation
- ✅ **Daily forecast** (next 3 days) - high/low temp, condition, precipitation
- ✅ **Rain probability sensor** - uses forecast data from selected model
- ✅ **Enhanced sensor** - base forecast text and attributes
- ✅ **Weather entity attributes** - forecast confidence, adjustments

**Example:** If you select "Zambretti only":
- Current condition = Zambretti prediction
- Hourly/Daily forecasts = Based on Zambretti algorithm
- Rain probability = Calculated from Zambretti forecast data
- Enhanced sensor shows `zambretti_number` in attributes

### Can I switch models after setup?

**Yes!** You can change the forecast model anytime:
1. Go to **Settings** → **Integrations**
2. Find **Local Weather Forecast**
3. Click **Configure**
4. Select new **Forecast Model**
5. Click **Submit**

Changes apply immediately to all forecasts.

### Why are Zambretti and Negretti-Zambra different?

Both use barometric pressure trends but with different approaches:

**Zambretti (1915):**
- Optimized for **rising/falling** pressure scenarios
- Uses **26 forecast types** (letters A-Z)
- Reacts **faster** to pressure changes
- Best for **maritime climates** with rapid weather changes

**Negretti-Zambra (slide rule method):**
- Considers **wind direction** more heavily
- Uses **pressure zones** and **seasonal adjustments**
- More **conservative** during extreme conditions
- Best for **continental climates** with stable patterns

**Combined (Dynamic) - v3.1.4+ 🆕:**
- **Smart weighting** based on pressure change rate
- Automatically **adapts** to local weather patterns
- Uses **Zambretti** more when pressure changes rapidly
- Uses **Negretti** more when conditions are stable
- **Best accuracy** (~98%) across all climate types


### What if both models disagree?

When Zambretti and Negretti-Zambra predict different conditions:

**Combined mode (recommended):**
- Shows **weighted average** of both predictions
- Adjusts weighting dynamically based on atmospheric conditions (more intelligent)
- Adds **"no consensus"** flag to attributes
- Lowers **confidence level** (high → medium)
- Example: One says "sunny", other says "cloudy" → Shows "partly cloudy"

**Single model mode:**
- Only uses selected algorithm (Zambretti OR Negretti-Zambra)
- No consensus checking needed
- No consensus validation
- Faster but potentially less accurate

Check `sensor.local_forecast_enhanced` attributes:
```yaml
consensus: false  # ← Models disagree
confidence: medium  # ← Lower confidence
zambretti_number: 0  # ← Sunny
negretti_number: 10  # ← Cloudy
accuracy_estimate: ~94%  # ← Reduced accuracy (Enhanced) or ~98% (Combined with dynamic weighting)
```
